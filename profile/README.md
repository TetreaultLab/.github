# Welcome to Martine T√©treault's Lab
In our lab at the CHUM Research Center in Montr√©al, Canada we focus on the study of molecular mechanisms in **neuromuscular** and **neurodegenerative** diseases as well 
as identifying genetic causes and modulators. We use a combination of omics and functional genomics approaches. The laboratory aims to increase diagnostic performance 
and discover new mechanisms associated with disease progression as well as phenotypic variability that could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

Some of the technologies we use are:
* RNA-sequencing, WGS and WES
* Single-cell RNA sequencing
* Long read sequencing
* CRISPR/Cas9

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
